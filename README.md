# A-Complete-S-Shape-Feed-Rate-Scheduling-Approach-for-NURBS-Interpolation
This Code Contains a jerk limited NURBS interpolation algorithm which is derived from "A completeS-shape feed rate scheduling approach for NURBS interpolator" by "Xu Du,JieHuang,Li-MinZhu"
To run this code just simply open "CompeletjerklimitednurbsXYZ.m", Change the input parameters (Velocity,ACC,Initial Velocity,...) and wait for the output
